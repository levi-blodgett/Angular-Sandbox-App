Components - The bulk of Angular apps, each piece of the UI can be organized to contain a class and a template, and the class and template can be bound to each other different ways, and each piece is their own component.
Why components? Code organization, break up the UI, contain properties and methods, better teamwork, and it promotes reusability.

Constructors automatically run when page is loaded, so they are often used to instantiate things.

Types (part of TypeScript), help with errors by making sure you don't assign a string to a number and such.

To change the "app" it is looking at, change the app.component.html from "app-user" to "app-users" or vice versa.

ngFor = like an attribute, need to use an asterisk before it, it is called a structural directive. See "users.component.html" for an example of it in use.

To make something optional, put a "?" immediately following the variable.
